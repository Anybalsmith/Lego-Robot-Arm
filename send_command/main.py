# This demo makes your PC talk to an EV3 over Bluetooth.
#
# This is identical to the EV3 client example in ../bluetooth_client
#
# The only difference is that it runs in Python3 on your computer, thanks to
# the Python3 implementation of the messaging module that is included here.
# As far as the EV3 is concerned, it thinks it just talks to an EV3 client.
#
# So, the EV3 server example needs no further modifications. The connection
# procedure is also the same as documented in the messaging module docs:
# https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/messaging.html
#
# So, turn Bluetooth on on your PC and the EV3. You may need to make Bluetooth
# visible on the EV3. You can skip pairing if you already know the EV3 address.

# Replace with your EV3 Bluetooth address

# Attendez et lisez la r√©ponse du serveur (EV3)
